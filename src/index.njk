        <p>Welcome to my personal homepage &mdash; get comfy and browse around.</p>
        <p>i am a queer person, designing things and living in between countries while feeling half away. 
            this homepage is a collection of ideas and a personal safe space for freedom and exploration. 
            while I build my profile page, here's a few things about me.</p>

<p>my html/css can be messy
i like Izuku Midoriya and BNHA
i listen to MJ, Linkin Park, Âµê„ÄÄand SixTONES
writing feels liberating and I keep several journals
travel through this site and enjoy, I'll keep this updated. üå∏</p>
