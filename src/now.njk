<article class="post-item">
<h2 class="post-title-page">{{ title }}</h2>
<p class="post-links">Last updated: 13 Mar 2024</p>

<p>This page is meant to be a snapshot of my life â€” my interests, goals, feelings, passions, what I am doing currently, and my future plans. 

Inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/" target="_blank">nownownow</a>.</p>

<h3 class="page-section-header">What am I up to?</h3>
<div class="page-divider"></div>
<p>I am <em>still</em> preparing to move to ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Canada! I will be moving to Toronto very, VERY soon and most of my energy is focused toward that at the moment. That, and this blog!</p>

<p>I am also actively looking for a job and have been finishing up my design <a href="https://anith.design" target="_blank">folio</a>. (A portfolio is never truly "finished", but I think I have definitely reached a stopping point for now. ðŸŽ‰)</p>

<h3 class="page-section-header">Last photo I took</h3>
<div class="page-divider"></div>
<div class="img-container">
    {% image "pkmn-gba.jpeg", "Photo showing Magikarp from Pokemon Ruby on a Gameboy Advance SP" %}
</div>
<p> I found my old Gameboy while doing some cleaning today, and I was surprised to see that my old Pokemon Ruby save file STILL works. I found this Pokedex entry for Magikarp a tad funny too.</p>

<h3 class="page-section-header">Reading</h3>
<div class="page-divider"></div>
<p>I've been reading a lot of books over the last 3 months. This is my current read: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapterhouse: Dune, by Frank Herbert</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am very excited to finish reading Dune. I really liked Heretics, and I can't wait to see how Chapterhouse (and the series, possibly) ends.</p>

<h3 class="page-section-header">Listening to</h3>
<div class="page-divider"></div>
<p>I managed to link my <a href="https://last.fm/user/pxperlove" target="_blank">last.fm</a> listening data to my blog through its API. That means this section will always be accurate! (The 'Listened' time is in UTC though, and I may get around to fixing it at some point later.)
<div class="now-playing-container">
    <div class="album-art">
        <img id="album-artwork" class="alb-art" alt="album artwork"/>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="labels">
            <span class="row-label">Track</span>
            <span id="track-name" class="row-data"></span>
            <span class="row-label">Artist</span>
            <span id="artist-name" class="row-data"></span>

<h3 class="page-section-header">Watching</h3>
<div class="page-divider"></div>
<p>The YouTube algorithm overlord has begun recommending me Lego videos two days ago, and I am amazed by the creativity and the engineering that goes into some of the builds that people make.</p> 

<h3 class="page-section-header">The Future</h3>
<div class="page-divider"></div>
<p>No plans at the moment until I get settled.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to take some courses and work on some personal ideas but I haven't been able to make time unfortunately. There is a lot going on.</p>
<p>âœ¨ In terms of my blog though:</p> 
<ul>
<li><p>I plan to write more about design, creativity, and the creative practice this year. I've marked some  podcasts/lectures/books to help put me on that path.</p></li>
<li><p>While working on revamping my blog, I was thinking I might share some links/bookmarks/interesting finds... probably introduce tags at some point to help categorise posts.</p></li> 
<li><p>I think I may also add a /log page at some point to my blog to keep track of all media I've consumed. We shall see!</p></li>
</ul>
