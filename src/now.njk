<p class="post-links">Last updated: 9 Mar 2024.</p>

<p>This page is meant to be a snapshot of my life â€” my interests, goals, feelings, passions, what I am doing currently, and my future plans. 

Inspired by <a href="sivers.org/now" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> and <a href="https://nownownow.com/" target="_blank">many others</a>.</p>

<h3>What am I up to?</h3>
<p>I'm preparing to move to ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Canada! I will be moving to Toronto very soon and most of my energy is focused towards that at the moment.</p>

<p>I am also looking for a job and have been finishing up my design <a href="https://anith.design" target="_blank">folio</a>. (A portfolio is never truly "finished", but I think I have definitely reached a stopping point for now. ðŸŽ‰)</p>

<h3>Last photo I took</h3>

<p> I took this photo today (9 Mar 2024) â€” a random photo that I took 10 years ago using an old Sony camcorder that I found while doing some spring cleaning. Good memories! I don't know I why I took so many photos of my eyes HAHA.</p>

<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>I've been reading a lot of books over the last 3 months. These are my current reads: </p>
<ul>
<li> Heretics of Dune, by Frank Herbert </li>
<li> Looking for Alaska, by John Green</li>
<li> The Daily Stoic, by Ryan Holiday </li>
</ul>

<p>The most recent series I've read is the Farseer trilogy, by Robin Hobb, and it was absolutely enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Listening to</h3>
<p>I made a Spring playlist today â€” so it's mostly that. Playlist below!</p>

<h3>Watching</h3>
<p>Nothing really â€” I haven't watched anything on Netflix (or other streaming services) in a LONG time.</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>No plans at the moment until I get settled.</p>
<p>ðŸ’¡ In terms of my blog, I think I may add a /log page at some point to my blog to keep track of all media I've consumed. We shall see!</p>
