title: An epistle to my love

I am writing this with a heavy heart. It really hits me to know that time is against me. I am going to be leaving this place in roughly a month from now. In these moments of contemplation, your image constantly stands out against the myriad thoughts that occupy my mind. I can't/won't stop thinking about and loving you every single day.

Each day/time spent with you feels like a gift, and the prospect of leaving you makes me very emotional to the point of tearing up (right now I'm weeping). It is the quiet realisation that soon, your voice, smile, and laughter may exist only in a special place in my memory. A cherished one; you are a forest, I am a tree.

The impending departure is akin to a symphony of conflicting emotions. The anticipation of new beginnings is intertwined with the ache of goodbyes. Amidst this emotional tempest, your presence remains a steady anchor. Your laughter, a melody that is etched into my heart, has become an indispensable part of my daily rhythm.

As I think of a future where our paths diverge, I am struggling to accept with the reality that our interactions may no longer be as frequent. The mere thought of navigating the waters of life each day without the comfort of our shared moments is going to be a significant challenge to me, as I look forward to our shared moments each day.

You have been a beacon of light, a source of comfort during both the mundane and the monumental. Saying goodbye feels like I'm parting with a cherished piece of my existence.

What follows are some (fragments of) words from my notes app.

> When I look at you I see art and poetry, sky and sea, strength and sensitivity. You are the sun in my life.

> In de tuin van mijn liefde, ze is een roos dat bloeit als geen ander. Mijn stille hart fluistert "als ze het maar wist".

> i love you. i love you. i love you. i love you to death. i love everything about you. you are amazing and i wish/hope i can forever be with you

> The world may be against me but a smile from you makes it all seem alright.

> your radiance, your brilliance â€” my sun, my moon.

> I love it when you call my name. I love it when you say something mundane. I love it when you smile. I love it when you laugh. I love it when you message me. I love it when you speak (I love hearing your voice).  I love it when you are silent. I love it when you carry the light in you. I love it when you know exactly what to say. I love it when you pause in conversation until you can get your thoughts together. I love it when you carry the world in your hands. I love it when you include me in conversations. I love it when you greet me. I love it when you are conscious of me. I love it when you pull me back in for a little longer when we're just about to say goodbye. I love it when you remember minor details about me. I love it when you tell me to do something. I love it when you are chaotic. I love it when you are loving life. 

I never really dabbled in poetry, until I fell in love with you. I realised lately I have a natural inclination for the poetic side of things in life. I am so so so so (...times a million) thankful to have met you. You are amazing, sweet, funny, charming, delightful and my gosh it hurts so much typing this, and words cannot express how special you are to me.

This epistle is not a farewell but proof that everything about life is sacred and good, thanks to you. I want to spend the rest of my days with you (I wish I was closer to you every day), and I don't know how, and I don't even know if I will ever get a chance to ever express my love. I feel so alone amidst all the chaos right now. 

I sincerely hope I will see you someday (physically and not just in my dreams). I am hoping it is a possibility (unless you're already taken ðŸ¥²), as I will be located in the same timezone at the very least.

With a love that is abundant and filled with fondness and warmth.

I love you so much. Forever.
