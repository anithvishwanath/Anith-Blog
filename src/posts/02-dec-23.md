(Title pun definitely intended.)

I find myself easily swayed by music — a force that becomes a potent catalyst that shapes the essence of my creative practice and expression — whether it's design, writing, or art.

Sometimes, a single piece of music becomes the driving force behind my creation, as is the case with this post. "Sense of Doubt" by David Bowie is playing as I write. The song's foreboding undertones currently resonate with my feelings of anxiety and moments of uncertainty, yet it also has an underlying resilience that inspires me to push through and embrace the creative process.

As I am typing this, I am amused by the rhythm of my typing transforming the clickety-clack of my handy-dandy mechanical keyboard into a digital brushstroke on this giant personal canvas of mine. It feels akin to orchestrating a symphony, with each keystroke producing a unique blend of harmonies and dissonances.
