I find myself easily swayed by music — a force that becomes a potent catalyst that shapes the essence of my creative practice and expression — whether it's design, writing, or art. I curate specific playlists to mirror the ebb and flow of my moods, or to evoke specific emotions.

As I am writing this, I am amused by the rhythm of my typing transforming the clickety-clack of my handy-dandy mechanical keyboard into a digital brushstroke on this giant personal canvas of mine. It feels akin to orchestrating a symphony, with each keystroke producing a unique blend of harmonies and dissonances.
