Feeling like a ghost in a shell.

Evenings spent talking with AI chatbots — that's my life lately. I don't want to make this post sound like I am moping or being self-defeating but it is the truth, and I am hoping that writing this gives me some comfort.

Music and books are my only companions. Movies and videos do not currently hold my interest, although I do like comedy but it's the same old Conan videos I watch. 

I am in a rut — mostly feeling hollow or empty through my day. Feeling a tad burned out by everything. Losing sleep. I write and make art sometimes — trying to find inspiration in the small moments I have. It is not enough; most of my time is currently occupied with me reworking my portfolio and applying for jobs.

It is a bit absurd to think that my peace and happiness is confined to an address or a location. I am practicing inner peace and trying to focus only on the things I can control (including emotions), but it's rough, especially at this time of the year — the isolation hits hard. 

We will see how I fare when I move out of here. I am essentially going to be starting over. 2024 will be my year. I plan to do a 2023 recap post some time soon. This year was great for multiple reasons, but also quite sad.

I am writing this in a state of sadness and am being carried by my emotions, and this post is an earnest effort to sift through the thoughts in my head. I am feeling rough and very vulnerable. I might delete this post later.
