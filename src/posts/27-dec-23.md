_(I'm sat trying to recollect everything that happened in 2023 and am currently struggling to write. I'll begin by the usual â€” distancing me from myself, and, like an objective viewer, taking a snapshot of the immediate surroundings I'm presently in... hoping my mind gradually gets to a point where I begin focusing inward.)_

Warm sunlight is spilling through my window, defying the season's usual cloak of grey, bathing the room in a golden glow. It is not the greatest backdrop for reflection and sifting through the memories that make up 2023 â€” a year that seems to have flown by rather quickly. As I bask in this warmth, there are some feelings of nostalgia and anticipation stirring within me. There was joy, happiness, sorrow, and grief in roughly equal parts, and a lot of yearning, manifesting, and hope.

Career-wise, it was a great year â€” perhaps the best one yet. It was fantastic as I feel I've grown and have learned a lot this year, thanks to some AMAZING folks I met. It was all very fun and I am super thankful to the universe to have sent them my way. I will forever love, cherish, and be grateful to each of them. If I had to do it all again, I would not change a single thing.

At this point, I must mention the fact that I currently feel like I am collaging myself into being by (subconsciously) taking each person's bits and pieces of their personalities and incorporating it into my own; becoming more of the self that I have been finding. 

My personality definitely feels like a mosaic; each person so far left a distinct impression and has added a unique tile to the grander picture. I wish I could drop their names so bad... I am learning to be confident and possibly a bit bold through the calm confidence of an amazing person who is my sun and my anchor â€” someone who is very close to my heart; finding joy and happiness through her smile and laughter. From her and a few others, I'm learning the art of asking the right questions, embracing humor in the everyday, paying closer attention to detail, and staying humble, patient, boundlessly generous, kind, and open-minded.

I will very much miss all of them as I part ways next year, and I genuinely hope to stay in touch with them all, if not just the one.

Personally, I turned 30 this year. I have accepted and am at peace with the fact that I'm officially in my 30s now â€” I love it. I feel like I'm being more patient with myself, embracing more of my personality, and am being open to things every day. In the grand scheme of things, I don't really feel any different â€” although I've noticed that my lower back starts to hurt if I sit for too long in a bad posture, so I am trying to be mindful of my posture of late (oh how I miss being 22). I will certainly have to dedicate some time to fitness next year. 

I am letting myself _feel_ more, instead of suppressing my emotions. I think writing and art definitely helps and am presently finding therapy in drafting this post. I have also been trying to live more in the moment this year, instead of constantly thinking about the past; my sister once said to me "you live in the past," (I wonder if it's an older sibling thing, ha). I am extremely thankful for her, and want to borrow some of her spirit. She is like a cat; does what she wants and just enjoys existing.

I lost my grandmother early in the year. I have allowed myself to grieve and mourn her loss but am still filled with grief and sorrow from time to time. I still feel her absence and it is particularly painful to me since I spent a lot of time with her as a child. I believe she is in a better place now and I love her. She taught me to be gentle and kind, to live humbly without thinking too much of yourself/having too much of an ego, and to be resilient and caring.

One MAJOR highlight of this year was that I fell in love, evinced by those earlier entries penned to my love. I haven't really felt like I've ever been in love in my life, mostly because I have always sought comfort in the steady rhythm of my work and craft.

I feel she might genuinely be the one for me and I love this feeling; whenever I talk to her, I blush and smile like an idiot (physically) and MELT (metaphorically), the latter especially when I hear her voice. I constantly think of her by day and night because she makes me feel tender, warm, and fuzzy, and I spend time making playlists in her honor (and to process & cope with said feelings ðŸ« ). 
 
With her, it was love at first sight; it was her personality â€” the warmth, the sound of her laughter, her voice, her eyes, her smile, her confidence, and her quiet resolve in terms of how she supports me and makes me feel when I'm feeling vulnerable. I could go on and on and on... and it is entirely possible that I am beginning to daydream now, for she IS dreamy. Snapping back to reality (oh there goes gravity...), I don't yet know what will happen next, but presently, I find a lot of hope and yearning in the uncertainty. She gives me hope and comfort. I am thankful for her entering my life and would like her to be my friend at the very least, because she is amazing and everything she does is magic.

I want to send her messages more often at this point because I am leaving soon. I will miss her very, very dearly and don't want to lose her. Hoping I do the right things and do things right. I love you. I love you. I love you.

Another major highlight of the year was that I received an invitation to become a permanent resident of Canada this year, and have chosen to move to Toronto in February 2024; I am filled with hope and determination. Without dwelling too much into my past, I must confess, for the past five years, I've been feeling like a zombie â€” hollow and stuck in a rut, and have been living the same life ever since the pandemic ended. I am happy and excited for a change!

I am very keen on spending time in the wilderness, out of the doors. I haven't traveled much this year â€” have not spent much time outdoors (although I go for long walks and jogs randomly). I am sure that is a contributing factor to my feeling like a zombie.

I also haven't created much this year owing to me feeling burned out, and a general lack of time and motivation (poor excuse, I know). In 2024, I plan to create more things for myself and my friends. 2022 was a great year for productivity as I worked on a lot of personal projects (still proud of the fact that I managed to make a logo for myself â€” making things for yourself can be tough). 

I sincerely hope to fully get back into my creative practice starting next year. I am sure I can make some time for it. I mean I've gotten back to writing this year (so glad I'm off Twitter), and can manage my time to include art and design into the mix.

_Author's note: I think I may have a lot more to add to this post, and will come back later as I'm exhausted and need to get back to working on my portfolio. Or this post could even be a two-parter! WHO KNOWS._
