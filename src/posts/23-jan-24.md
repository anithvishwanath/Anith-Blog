I wanted to have a handy reference to my highlighted passages and quotes from the book 'Meditations' by Marcus Aurelius.

### On life/death
> Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has been lived already, or is impossible to see.  

> Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them.

> Death: something like birth, a natural mystery, elements that split and recombine. Not an embarrassing thing. Not an offense to reason, or our nature.

> Human life. Duration: momentary. Nature: changeable. Perception: dim. Condition of Body: decaying. Soul: spinning around. Fortune: unpredictable. Lasting Fame: uncertain. Sum Up: The body and its parts are a river, the soul a dream and mist, life is warfare and a journey far from home, lasting reputation is oblivion.

> If it's time for you to go, leave willingly—as you would to accomplish anything that can be done with grace and honor.

### On living
> Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.

> If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.

> When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive—to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.

> **How to act**  <br/>
>> Never under compulsion, out of selfishness, without forethought, with misgivings.  <br/>
>> Don’t gussy up your thoughts.  <br/>
>> No surplus words or unnecessary actions.  <br/>
>> Let the spirit in you represent a man, an adult, a citizen, a Roman, a ruler. Taking up his post like a soldier and awaiting his recall from life.  <br/>
> **Cheerfulness.** Without requiring other people’s help. Or serenity supplied by others.  <br/>
>> To stand up straight—not straightened.

> Life is short. That's all there is to say. Get what you can from the present—thoughtfully, justly. Unrestrained moderation.

> Not to live as if you had endless years ahead of you. Death overshadows you. While you're alive and able—be good.

> [...] To get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human—however imperfectly—and fully embrace the pursuit you've embarked on.

> Don't let the mind start in judgments, calling [something] "good" or "bad."

> Treat human beings as they deserve, be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.

> So other people hurt me? That's their problem. Their character and actions are not mine. What is done to me is ordained by nature, what I do by my own.

> The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.

> Practice the virtues you can show: honesty, gravity, endurance, patience, austerity, resignation, abstinence, patience, sincerity, moderation, seriousness, high-mindedness. Don't you see how much you have to offer—beyond excuses like "can't?" And yet you still settle for less.

> You have a mind? —Yes. Well, why not use it? Isn't that all you want—for it to do its job?

### On fate (or, amor fati)
> There are two reasons to embrace what happens. One is that it's happening to you. It was prescribed for you, and it pertains to you. The thread was spun long ago, by the oldest cause of all.

> Remember two things: i. that everything has always been the same, and keeps recurring, and it makes no difference whether you see the same things recur in a hundred years or two hundred, or in an infinite period; ii. that the longest-lived and those who will die soonest lose the same thing. The present is all that they can give up, since that is all you have, and what you do not have you cannot lose.

> Matter. How tiny your share of it. Time. How brief and fleeting your allotment of it. Fate. How small a role you play in it.

### On overcoming procrastination/laziness

> At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: ‘I have to go to work—as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for—the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?'  <br/>
—But it’s nicer here…  <br/>
So you were born to feel ‘nice’? Instead of doings things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?  <br/>
—But we have to sleep sometime…  <br/>
Agreed. But nature set a limit on that—as it did on eating and drinking. And you’re over the limit. You’ve had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you’re still below your quota. You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they’re really possessed by what they do, they’d rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts.
