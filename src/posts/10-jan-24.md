Crafting my portfolio with my tender hands,  
carefully folding, origami-like, into a paper lantern  
Watching it ascend gracefully into the twilight sky, 
carrying my craft and creations to distant realms  

Then, I wander through unexplored thickets,  
my thoughts unburdened and reclaimed
Inhaling the cold woodland air into the core of my being,  
maybe feeling the purity of breath and the air
