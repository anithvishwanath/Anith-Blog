Inspired to write some haikus for my friends after reading a hilarious haiku book by my fave racing driver of all time, Kimi Räikkönen.

#1
Brush strokes kindle dreams
His passion ignites my own fire
Together, we create

#2
Warm words, gentle touch
Her eyes find my hidden spark
Golden light, my guide

#3
Laughter shared like wine
Her wit, a spirited surprise
Friendship's sweetest joy

#4
Soft nudges propel
Towards lofty peaks we ascend
Guiding light, steadfast

#5
Radiant laughter
Bringing joy with every smile
Sweet friend, ever bright

#6
Gentle soul, deep thought
Quiet wisdom, softly shared
Through her gentle grace

#7
Few words, warm and kind
Always present, a silent strength
True friend, like a rock
