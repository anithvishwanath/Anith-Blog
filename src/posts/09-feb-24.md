Inspired to write some haikus for my friends after reading a hilarious haiku book by my favorite racing driver of all time, Kimi Räikkönen.

#1 matthias
Brush strokes kindle dreams
His passion ignites my own fire
Together, we create

#2 
Warm words, gentle touch
Her eyes find my hidden spark
Golden light, my guide

#3 kimchi
Laughter shared like wine
Her wit, a spirited surprise
Friendship's sweetest joy
 
#4 simon
Soft nudges propel
Towards lofty peaks we ascend
Guiding light, steadfast

#5
Gentle soul, deep thought
Quiet wisdom, softly shared
Through her gentle grace

#6
Few words, warm and kind
Always present, a silent strength
True friend, like a rock

#7 joey
Silly jokes bloom bright
Tears of laughter fill the air
Sunshine in his smile
