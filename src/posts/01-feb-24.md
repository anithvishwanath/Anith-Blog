Staying put and patient, currently writing this in a moment of deep realisation and sonder—feeling very present in the here/now and at peace with my rebel heart with what is yet to come. At the same time, spending time with the folks I love—for I'll leave soon and possibly be alone for some time in a new setting. Sat wondering what to do with all this free time I have. Feeling bored; bored might be good. Watching Mission Impossible movies. 

I'm in love with the phrase "can't wait" lately.

I find myself pleased with where I am currently—accepting fate knowing I can't control anything except face obstacles—to live is to struggle, and am freely letting myself be pulled in the direction I chose. I am pleased with the feedback I've gotten from folks from my workplace, knowing I've had a net positive impact in the hearts of many I've met and how dearly I will be missed. I am pleased by the smiles and hearty laughs of my dear friends. I am pleased by the 'deep' talks about space (skygazing), and silly conspiracy theories with drunk friends in their libations until 3 AM, where I'm deeply laughing, amused by their stupor and the frivolity. I am pleased to be myself—to feel a bit more comfortable in my own skin, and be able to make my friends feel safe and loved.

Quoting a recurring motif in a lot of Fred again.. songs: "We gon' make it through."
