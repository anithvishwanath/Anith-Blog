I yearn to grasp her radiance but she is a distant sun. Her beauty embodied in the rich brown hues of her hair reflects the warmth of her personality. Her voice, smile, and laughter eternally etched into my heart — drawing and binding my soul to hers. I long for a connection that remains elusive, my love unrequited.

A whirlwind of passion and determination, she has left a lasting impression upon me. Her spirit makes me giddy, yet is very inspiring for it empowers my soul and instills confidence, and her wit and charm light up the room. She is a gem, and has a grace as captivating as the moon’s gentle glow; her smile sets my heart alight.

In the hushed stillness of my room, I find comfort in the beauty of her essence — a woman of substance and elegance. A crush that may stay beyond my reach, for she may never possibly know my feelings for her, yet she will remain forever cherished.
