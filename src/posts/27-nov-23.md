I yearn to grasp her radiance but she is a distant sun, for her beauty and the rich brown hues in her hair reflect the warmth of her personality. Her voice, smile, and laughter eternally etched into my heart — drawing and binding my soul to hers, as I long for a connection that remains elusive, and my love unrequited.

A whirlwind of passion and determination, she has left a lasting impression upon me. Her spirit makes me giddy and yet is very inspiring for it empowers my soul and instills confidence, and her wit and charm lights up the room. She’s a gem, her grace as captivating as the moon’s gentle glow; her smile sets one's heart alight.
