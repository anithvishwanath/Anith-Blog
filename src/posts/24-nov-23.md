title: Tables, not Fences

As I lay in bed, stirred by the gentle chirping of birds in the early morning hours, sleep slipping away like elusive dreams, I found comfort in the glow of my phone screen. Opening Instagram, a friend, Simon (whom I greatly love and admire; Simon if you’re reading this, I love you) had shared a post in his stories, adding an unexpected touch of a bit of profound reflection in the quiet hours.

The post (in Dutch) reads:

> "Als je het beter hebt dan anderen, bouw je een langere tafel, geen hoger hek"

…which in English translates to — "If you have it better than others, build a longer table, not a higher fence." 

Putting that into perspective into my own creative practice, I find among my creative peers, a rush and a push for becoming someone great<sup>[1]</sup> — manifesting in an unrelenting pursuit of accolades and recognition, to the point where work sometimes inadvertently happens in siloes; with individuals focusing on different aspects of a project, akin to being separated by fences. However, I believe there should be room at the table for everyone. I personally find solace in the embrace of genuine, wholehearted moments of collaboration. 

I express gratitude for friends and colleagues who have generously extended their support — individuals who have not only inspired me but also elevated me – my mentors, collaborators, and kindred spirits. I picture them as pillars of strength, much like the morning sun and crisp breeze that accompany the start of a new day.<sup>[2]</sup>

I am thankful for those who have shared insights, ideas, and camaraderie, cultivating an environment that brims with creativity and joy. In this grand tapestry of my creative journey, I've come to realize that success isn't solely defined by the rat race's yardstick. What truly matters to me is the impact I have on my fellow creatives—the doors I open, the pathways I illuminate, much in the same way that my peers have done for me.

<small>[1] I wish to emphatically emphasize that aspiring for greatness is entirely valid and getting recognized is great — I celebrate ALL my friends' and colleagues' wins, and they do the same for me, recognizing our shared desire for validation in our work. Here, I am focusing mainly on the collaborative aspects. </small>
