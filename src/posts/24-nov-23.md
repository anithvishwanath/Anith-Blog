title: Tables, not Fences

As I lay in bed, stirred by the gentle chirping of birds in the early morning hours, sleep slipping away like elusive dreams, I found comfort in the glow of my phone screen. Opening Instagram, a friend, Simon (whom I greatly love and admire; Simon if you’re reading this, I love you) had shared a post in his stories, adding an unexpected touch of profound reflection in the quiet hours.

The post (in Dutch) reads:

> "Als je het beter hebt dan anderen, bouw je een langere tafel, geen hoger hek"

…which in English translates to — "If you have it better than others, build a longer table, not a higher fence." 

Putting that into perspective into my own creative practice, I find among my creative peers, a rush and a push for becoming someone great<sup>[1]</sup> — manifesting in an unrelenting pursuit of accolades and recognition, to the point where work sometimes inadvertently happens in siloes; with individuals focusing on different aspects of a project, akin to being separated by fences. However, I believe there should be room at the table for everyone. I personally find solace in the embrace of genuine, wholehearted moments of collaboration. 

I express gratitude for friends and colleagues who have generously extended their support — individuals who have not only inspired me but also elevated me – my mentors, collaborators, and kindred spirits. They are like the reliable morning sun and the refreshing crisp breeze, providing a steadfast foundation and invigorating energy as I navigate my creative journey.<sup>[2]</sup>

I am thankful for the people who have shared ideas and camaraderie, folks who have played a part in cultivating an environment that brims with creativity and joy. So far into my creative journey, I have come to realise that success isn't solely defined by the rat race's yardstick. What truly matters to me is the impact I have on my fellow creatives—the doors I open, the pathways I illuminate, the friendships I make — much in the same way that my peers have done for me.

<small>[1] I wish to emphatically emphasize that aspiring for greatness is entirely valid and getting recognized is great — I celebrate ALL my friends' and colleagues' wins, and they do the same for me, recognising our shared desire for validation in our work. Here, I am focusing mainly on the collaborative aspects. </small>
