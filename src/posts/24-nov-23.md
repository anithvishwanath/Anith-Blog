title: Tables, not Fences

As I lay in bed, stirred by the gentle chirping of birds in the early morning hours, sleep slipping away like elusive dreams, I found comfort in the glow of my phone screen. Opening Instagram, a friend, Simon (whom I greatly love and admire; Simon if you’re reading this, I love you) had shared a post in his stories, adding an unexpected touch of profound reflection in the quiet hours.

The post (in Dutch) reads:

> "Als je het beter hebt dan anderen, bouw je een langere tafel, geen hoger hek"

…which in English translates to — "If you have it better than others, build a longer table, not a higher fence." 

Putting that into perspective into my creative practice so far, I find among some of my creative peers, a desire and a rush and a push to become someone great<sup>[1]</sup> — manifesting in an unrelenting pursuit of accolades and recognition, to the point where work sometimes inadvertently gets siloed; which happens when folks are independently focusing on different aspects of the project, akin to being separated by fences. I believe there should be room at the table for everyone. I personally find solace in the embrace of genuine, wholehearted moments of collaboration. 

I express gratitude for friends and colleagues who have generously extended their support — people who have not only inspired me but also elevated me — my mentors, collaborators, and kindred spirits. They are like the reliable morning sun and the refreshing crisp breeze, providing a steadfast foundation and invigorating energy<sup>[2]</sup> as I navigate my creative journey.

I am thankful to my friends who have shared ideas and camaraderie, and for teaching me the importance of creating an environment that not only ensures people feel safe but also nurtures cooperation. So far in my creative journey, I have come to realise that success isn't solely defined by the rat race's yardstick (again thanks to some extraordinary people I've met). What truly matters to me is the impact I have on my fellow creatives — the doors I open, the pathways I illuminate, the friendships I make — much in the same way that my peers have done for me.

<small>[1] I wish to emphatically emphasize that aspiring for greatness is entirely valid and getting recognised is great — I celebrate ALL my friends' and colleagues' wins, and they do the same for me, recognising our shared desire for validation in our work. Here, I am focusing mainly on potential impact of collaboration when a creative loses sight of the big picture. </small>
