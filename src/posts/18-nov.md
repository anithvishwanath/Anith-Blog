title: "Moving to Canada"

_Before I begin this post, I want to sincerely thank a very dear friend of mine, as they have encouraged me to write and I am very grateful for their kind words, wisdom, and inspiration._

I find myself staring at my computer screen thinking of what to write, for I have fallen out of practice of writing and journaling. It is night currently (10:34 PM) and all is quiet around me, and in this sombre setting, I just thought of the most obvious thing to write about.

I will be moving soon!

Far, far away from the land where I am located currently (India), I will be moving to the cool climes of Canada (specifically, Toronto). Presently, I have a weird rush of nostalgic feelings along with some sadness (as I will be moving away from the fam), and admittedly I am a bit intimidated by it all, yet I positively look forward to how my future unfolds. Thinking about it evokes a strong tempest of a lot of mixed and complex emotions within me. It all feels very bittersweet.

I'm really keen on the environmental changes — at this point, I look forward to winters the most. Indian winters are pleasant at best. I have experienced Australian (*Melburnian) winters which aren't very cold by the average European/North American standards (typically 6°C or 46°F in the mornings); I used to walk around in layered clothing. 

At this point in my writing, I am smiling because I just thought of an old friend from The Netherlands who once described to me the similarities in the weather patterns between Melbourne and Rotterdam ("always rainy, wet, and cold, and people looking like Fall/Winter catalog models in their layered clothes"). 

I still have distinct memories of the tip of my nose and hands feeling the cold, and can recollect that feeling to the point where I can, weirdly, still feel phantom sensations in my extremities—maybe the cells in my body were strongly affected by the cold, HAHA. Strange how the body remembers.

Speaking of layers, I also just thought of a chat I had with a friend (the same friend I mentioned in the beginning of this post) not too long ago, about what I need to get and they guided me and prepped me on lots of things I need to look out for. SO I am going to definitely be adding a lot of winter clothing to my wardrobe! (Thank you, friend!)

I also think getting back to having a social life may be another challenge, as I have pretty much spent the last three years indoors (remote work). I have definitely grown a lot in that period—it has taught me a lot of patience, humility, and gentleness. It feels weird to say it, but I think coming out of the pandemic, those are some of the traits I have gained—no rush, no hurry; resilience and fortitude; calmness and composure; still as a rock; like a reed floating by the river, embracing the currents of life. I am now spent on all the emotional traits and analogies I can think of, and will thus take it as a sign to end this post right here.

I seriously welcome the forthcoming challenges in the next chapter of my life, and hope to acclimatise to it.
