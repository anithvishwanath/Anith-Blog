Before I begin this post, I want to sincerely thank a very dear friend of mine, as they have encouraged me to write and I am very grateful for their kind words, wisdom, and inspiration.

I find myself staring at my computer screen thinking of what to write, for I have fallen out of practice of writing and journaling. It is night currently (10:34 PM) and all is quiet around me... until I thought of the obvious thing to write about.

I will be moving soon!

Far, far away from where I am located currently (India), I will be moving to the cool climes of Canada (specifically, Toronto). Presently, I have a weird rush of nostalgic emotion and yet I very much look forward to how my future unfolds. Thinking about it all evokes a strong tempest of (a lot of) mixed, complex emotions within me.

I'm really keen on the environmental changes — I look forward to winters the most. Indian winters are pleasant at best. I have experienced Australian (*Melbournian) winters which aren't very cold by European/North American standards (typically 6°C or 46°F in the mornings), and I used to roam around in layered clothing. At this point in my writing, I am smiling because I just thought of my friend from the Netherlands who had once described to me the similarities in the weather patterns between Melbourne and Rotterdam (always rainy/wet and cold, and people looking like Fall/Winter catalog models with their layered clothes)... I still have memories of the tip of my nose feeling cold, and can recollect that feeling to the point where I can almost feel the phantom sensations. I welcome this challenge and hope to acclimatise to it. 

Speaking of layers, I also fondly remember a chat I had with a friend (the very same friend I have written about in the beginning of this post) not too long ago, about what I need to get and they guided me and prepped me on lots of things I need to look out for. SO I am going to definitely be adding a lot of winter clothing to my wardrobe! (Thank you good friend!)

Personally, I think getting back to a social life is another challenge as I have spent the last three years indoors. I have certainly grown a lot—staying indoors has given me a lot of patience and gentleness. It feels weird to say it, but I think coming out of the pandemic, that is the only thing I have gained—no rush, no hurry; calmness and composure; still as a rock; like a reed floating by the river, embracing the currents of life. I am now spent of all the analogies I can think of and therefore think it is a good sign for me to end this post right here.
