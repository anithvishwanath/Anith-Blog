title: "Moving to Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦"

_Before I begin this post, I want to sincerely thank a very dear friend of mine, as they have encouraged me to write and I am very grateful for their kind words, wisdom, and inspiration._

I find myself staring at my computer screen thinking of what to write, for I have fallen out of practice of writing and journaling. It is night currently (10:34 PM) and all is quiet around me... and in this sombre setting, I just thought of the obvious thing to write about.

I will be moving soon!

Far, far away from where I am located currently (India), I will be moving to the cool climes of Canada (specifically, Toronto). Presently, I have a weird rush of nostalgic feelings (as I will be moving away from my family and friends) and am a bit intimidated by it all, yet I very much look forward to how my future unfolds. Thinking about it all evokes a strong tempest of (a lot of) mixed, complex emotions within me.

I'm really keen on the environmental changes â€” I look forward to winters the most. Indian winters are pleasant at best. I have experienced Australian (*Melbournian) winters which aren't very cold by European/North American standards (typically 6Â°C or 46Â°F in the mornings); I used to walk around in layered clothing. At this point in my writing, I am smiling because I just thought of an old friend from The Netherlands who once described to me the similarities in the weather patterns between Melbourne and Rotterdam (always rainy, wet, and cold, and people looking like Fall/Winter catalog models in their layered clothes). 

I still have memories of the tip of my nose and hands feeling cold, and can recollect that feeling to the point where I can, weirdly, feel the phantom sensations in my extremitiesâ€”maybe the cells in my body were strongly affected by the cold, HAHA. 

Speaking of layers, I also just remembered a chat I had with a friend (the same friend I mentioned in the beginning of this post) not too long ago, about what I need to get and they guided me and prepped me on lots of things I need to look out for. SO I am going to definitely be adding a lot of winter clothing to my wardrobe! (Thank you, friend!)

Personally, I also think getting back to a social life is another challenge, as I have spent the last three years indoors. I have definitely grown a lot in that periodâ€”staying indoors has given me a lot of patience, humility, and gentleness. It feels weird to say it, but I think coming out of the pandemic, that is the only thing I have gainedâ€”no rush, no hurry; calmness and composure; still as a rock; like a reed floating by the river, embracing the currents of life. I am now spent of all the analogies I can think of and therefore think it is a good sign for me to end this post right here.

I seriously welcome this challenge in the next phase of my life, and hope to acclimatise to it.
